In a long-forgotten age when dinosaurs still roamed the Earth, my internet presence existed in the form of an AOL Instant Messenger screen-name and an Angelfire page. Both of these have (thankfully) been lost to time. Other attempts followed:  a LiveJournal, a Blogger/Blogspot account, and others I probably don't remember. I am happy to say that I never had a Myspace account, and to this day I don't have a Twitter account either (I do, however, maintain a seldom-used Mastodon account). In an age where your "online presence" means tying your real name to every thought, word, and deed you may inadvertently commit online, I prefer to maintain an alias.

The "self-hosted blog" currently seems to be experiencing a renaissance as the hip alternative to the likes of WordPress and Blogger, and so as long as it requires nothing more than a GitHub account and some rudimentary  Markdown knowledge, I think I can manage. I don't necessarily see this blog being any more as a "permanent link" for announcements on any projects I might be working on, or expanded thoughts I might have while arguing with someone on HackerNews or Reddit. We will see where this goes.
