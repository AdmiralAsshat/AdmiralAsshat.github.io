title: Ebook Release - The Valley of Fear
---

My first contribution to the [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/) project has been released.

Book:[Arthur Conan Doyle - The Valley of Fear](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-valley-of-fear)

Repo: [GitHub](https://github.com/standardebooks/arthur-conan-doyle_the-valley-of-fear)

I had no particular investment in this book, but it was something easy to start with. I learned a great deal over the process of producing it. It's an exciting time to be on the project as new works start to enter the public domain for the first time in years. Hopefully my next production will require less hand-holding.

For reasons related to my (admittedly vulgar) handle, all references to me are scrubbed from the actual book, but at least my name lives on in [the commit history](https://github.com/standardebooks/arthur-conan-doyle_the-valley-of-fear/commits/master). Perhaps one day I will let this handle die and use something safely viewed by children.
